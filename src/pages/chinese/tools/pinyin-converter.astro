      <h3>What is Pinyin?</h3>
      <p>Pinyin (拼音) literally means "spell sounds" and is the standard system for writing Mandarin Chinese using the Latin alphabet. Created in the 1950s, it's now used worldwide for teaching Chinese pronunciation, typing Chinese on computers, and looking up words in dictionaries.</p>
      <h3>Understanding Tone Marks</h3>
      <p>Each pinyin syllable includes a tone mark that indicates which of the four tones to use. Getting the tones right is essential — the word "mā" (mother) has a completely different meaning from "mǎ" (horse)!</p>
