  { q: 'What are the grid guidelines for?', a: 'The diagonal cross guidelines in each cell help you center and proportion your characters correctly. They show you where the center of the cell is, making it easier to write balanced characters.' },
  { q: 'How many times should I write each character?', a: 'Writing each character 6-10 times is a good starting point. Focus on correct stroke order rather than speed. As you get comfortable, you can reduce repetitions and spend more time on new characters.' },
