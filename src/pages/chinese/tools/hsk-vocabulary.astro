  { q: 'What is HSK?', a: 'HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi / 汉语水平考试) is the standardized Chinese proficiency test recognized internationally. It has 6 levels, from HSK 1 (beginner, 150 words) to HSK 6 (advanced, 5000+ words). Our tool covers vocabulary from HSK 1-4.' },
  { q: 'How many HSK words should I learn per day?', a: 'A sustainable pace is 5-10 new words per day. At this rate, you can reach HSK 3 level (~600 words) in about 3-4 months. Quality matters more than quantity — make sure you can recognize, pronounce, and use each word.' },
  { q: 'Can I search across all HSK levels?', a: 'Yes! Use the search bar to find any word across all levels. You can search by Chinese character, pinyin, or English meaning.' },
