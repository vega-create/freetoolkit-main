      <h2>How to Use This Chinese Name Generator</h2>
      <p>Enter your English name and our tool will generate meaningful Chinese names tailored to you. Each name includes a common Chinese surname and a given name composed of characters with beautiful meanings.</p>

      <h3>Choosing the Right Name</h3>
      <p>Chinese names carry deep cultural significance. Unlike English names, each character in a Chinese name has its own meaning, and the combination of characters creates a unique narrative. Our generator groups characters by themes like wisdom, nature, beauty, and strength so you can find a name that resonates with your personality.</p>

      <h3>Traditional vs Simplified Characters</h3>
      <p>If you plan to use your Chinese name in Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Macau, select Traditional characters (繁體字). For mainland China or Singapore, choose Simplified characters (简体字). The pronunciation and meaning are the same — only the writing style differs.</p>

      <h3>Pronunciation</h3>
      <p>Click the 🔊 button next to any generated name to hear how it's pronounced. Use the 🐢 slow button to hear it at a slower speed, perfect for practicing. The pronunciation uses your browser's built-in text-to-speech engine.</p>
