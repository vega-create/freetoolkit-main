  { q: 'What are Chinese radicals?', a: 'Radicals (部首, bùshǒu) are the building blocks of Chinese characters. Most characters contain a radical that gives a hint about the character\'s meaning. For example, characters with the water radical (氵) often relate to water or liquids.' },
  { q: 'How many radicals are there?', a: 'The traditional Kangxi Dictionary lists 214 radicals. However, only about 50-80 radicals appear frequently in everyday characters. Our tool covers the most common ones you will encounter.' },
  { q: 'How do radicals help with learning?', a: 'Knowing radicals helps you guess the meaning of unfamiliar characters, look up characters in dictionaries, and memorize new characters by connecting them to familiar components.' },
