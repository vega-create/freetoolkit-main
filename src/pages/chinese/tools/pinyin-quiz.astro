  { q: 'What HSK level should I choose?', a: 'If you are just starting to learn Chinese, choose HSK 1. If you know basic vocabulary (200+ words), try HSK 2. HSK 3 includes intermediate vocabulary. The quiz adapts to include words from your level and below.' },
  { q: 'How is this different from the Tone Trainer?', a: 'The Tone Trainer focuses specifically on identifying tones (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th). The Pinyin Quiz tests your knowledge of the full pinyin reading of characters, including both the consonant/vowel sounds and the tone marks.' },
  { q: 'Are quiz scores saved?', a: 'Yes! Your best score and number of attempts are saved locally in your browser. Visit My Progress to see your scores across all quizzes.' },
