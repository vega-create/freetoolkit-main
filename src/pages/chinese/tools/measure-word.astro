  { q: 'What are Chinese measure words?', a: 'Measure words (量词, liàngcí) are required between a number and a noun in Chinese. Every noun has a specific measure word. For example, "one book" is 一本书 (yī běn shū), where 本 is the measure word for books.' },
  { q: 'What if I do not know the measure word?', a: 'When in doubt, you can use 个 (gè), which is the most common and general measure word. While not always correct, native speakers will still understand you. As you learn more, you will naturally pick up the specific measure words.' },
  { q: 'How many measure words are there?', a: 'Chinese has over 100 measure words, but about 20-30 cover most everyday situations. Our tool teaches the most common ones first, with real examples for each.' },
