const faq = [{ q: `Is Bopomofo only used in Taiwan?`, a: `Yes, Zhuyin or Bopomofo is primarily used in Taiwan. It is the standard phonetic system taught in Taiwanese schools and used on most Taiwanese keyboards. Mainland China, Singapore, and most international Chinese programs use Pinyin instead.` }, { q: `Can I learn both Pinyin and Bopomofo?`, a: `Absolutely. Since both systems represent the same sounds, learning one makes the other much easier. Many students start with Pinyin (as it uses familiar Latin letters) and add Zhuyin later if they plan to study in Taiwan.` }, { q: `Which system is better for learning Chinese?`, a: `Neither is objectively better. Pinyin has the advantage of using letters you already know. Bopomofo has the advantage of not being confused with English pronunciation. Your choice should depend on where you will primarily use Chinese.` }];

    <h2 id="overview">Overview: Two Systems, One Purpose</h2>
    <p>Both Pinyin and Bopomofo (Zhuyin Fuhao) serve the same fundamental purpose: representing the pronunciation of Chinese characters using phonetic notation. They cover exactly the same sounds — the difference is purely in the symbols used.</p>
    <p><strong>Pinyin</strong> uses Latin letters with tone marks: nǐ hǎo. Developed in the 1950s in mainland China, it is now the international standard for Chinese romanization.</p>
    <p><strong>Bopomofo</strong> (注音符號) uses unique phonetic symbols: ㄋㄧˇ ㄏㄠˇ. Created in the 1910s during the Republic of China era, it remains the primary system in Taiwan.</p>

    <h2 id="pinyin-advantages">Advantages of Pinyin</h2>
    <p><strong>Familiar alphabet:</strong> Since Pinyin uses Latin letters, learners who read English (or any language using the Latin alphabet) can start reading Pinyin immediately. There is no new writing system to learn first.</p>
    <p><strong>International standard:</strong> Pinyin is used in virtually all Chinese textbooks, language apps, dictionaries, and academic publications outside Taiwan. Knowing Pinyin gives you access to the broadest range of learning resources.</p>
    <p><strong>Technology support:</strong> All operating systems and devices support Pinyin input. Google Translate, language apps, and most digital tools use Pinyin.</p>

    <h2 id="bopomofo-advantages">Advantages of Bopomofo</h2>
    <p><strong>No English interference:</strong> Because Bopomofo symbols look nothing like English letters, learners do not accidentally apply English pronunciation habits. The letter "q" in Pinyin does not sound like the English "q," which causes confusion. Bopomofo avoids this entirely.</p>
    <p><strong>Taiwan context:</strong> In Taiwan, Bopomofo appears on children's books, some signs, and is the primary keyboard input method. Learning it opens up a whole world of Taiwanese learning materials.</p>
    <p><strong>Cultural immersion:</strong> Using Bopomofo signals engagement with Taiwanese culture. Many Taiwanese language partners and teachers appreciate learners who make the effort to use their native phonetic system.</p>

    <h2 id="which-to-learn">Which Should You Learn?</h2>
    <p><strong>Learn Pinyin first if:</strong> you are using international textbooks, studying for HSK, learning online, or plan to use Chinese primarily in mainland China.</p>
    <p><strong>Learn Bopomofo first if:</strong> you live in or plan to move to Taiwan, study at a Taiwanese university, or have a Taiwanese teacher who uses Zhuyin.</p>
    <p><strong>Best approach:</strong> Start with whichever matches your immediate context, then learn the other later. The transition is straightforward since both represent the same sounds.</p>
