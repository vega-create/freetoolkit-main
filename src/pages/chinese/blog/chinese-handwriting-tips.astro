    <h2 id="proportions">Character Proportions</h2>
    <p>Every Chinese character should fit within an imaginary square of equal height and width. Left-right characters (like 好) split roughly 40-60. Top-bottom characters (like 花) split 40-60 vertically. Enclosed characters (like 国) need the outer frame drawn slightly larger with the inner component centered.</p>

    <h2 id="common-mistakes">Common Handwriting Mistakes</h2>
    <p>Characters too small or uneven in size, strokes ending limply rather than with controlled stops, ignoring the standard grid proportions, and writing strokes in wrong order (which affects the flow and appearance). Use our <a href="/chinese/tools/stroke-order/">Stroke Order tool</a> to verify correct sequences.</p>

    <h2 id="daily-practice">Daily Practice Routine</h2>
    <p>Ten minutes daily is more effective than one hour weekly. Start each session by reviewing yesterday's characters, then practice today's new ones. Use grid paper or our <a href="/chinese/tools/practice-sheet/">Practice Sheet Generator</a> to maintain consistent character sizes. Write each character at least 5 times, focusing on stroke order and proportions rather than speed.</p>
