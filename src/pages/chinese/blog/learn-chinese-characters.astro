const faq = [{ q: `How many characters do I need to learn?`, a: `For basic literacy, about 1,000 characters cover approximately 90 percent of everyday text. For comfortable reading of newspapers and books, you need 2,500-3,000 characters. HSK 6 requires knowledge of about 2,663 characters.` }, { q: `Should I learn to write or just recognize characters?`, a: `Both are valuable but for different reasons. Writing reinforces recognition and memory. However, if your goal is primarily reading and typing, recognition-focused study is more efficient. Most modern Chinese input is done by typing Pinyin on a keyboard.` }, { q: `How long does it take to learn 1000 characters?`, a: `At a pace of 5-10 new characters per day with proper review, you can learn 1,000 characters in 4-8 months. The key is consistent daily practice and effective review to prevent forgetting.` }];

    <h2 id="start-with-components">Start with Components, Not Characters</h2>
    <p>The biggest mistake beginners make is trying to memorize characters as complex, indivisible pictures. A 15-stroke character looks impossibly complicated as a single unit, but break it into 2-3 familiar components and it becomes manageable.</p>
    <p>Start by learning the most common <a href="/chinese/blog/chinese-radicals/">radicals</a> — the building blocks that appear in hundreds of characters. Once you know 人 (person), 口 (mouth), 水 (water), 木 (wood), and 心 (heart) as individual components, many complex characters become logical combinations.</p>
    <p>For example, 休 (rest) combines 人 (person) and 木 (tree) — a person leaning against a tree to rest. This visual logic makes the character memorable without brute-force memorization.</p>

    <h2 id="stroke-order-matters">Why Stroke Order Matters</h2>
    <p>Stroke order (the sequence in which you write each line) might seem arbitrary, but it serves practical purposes. Following standard stroke order makes your handwriting smoother, more legible, and faster. It also makes handwriting recognition on phones and tablets work properly.</p>
    <p>The basic rules are: top to bottom, left to right, horizontal before vertical, outside before inside, and closing strokes last. Our <a href="/chinese/tools/stroke-order/">Stroke Order tool</a> shows the correct sequence for common characters.</p>
    <p>Physical writing engages motor memory, creating an additional pathway for recall. Even if you primarily type Chinese, occasional handwriting practice strengthens your ability to recognize characters.</p>

    <h2 id="memory-techniques">Memory Techniques That Work</h2>
    <p><strong>Mnemonics and stories:</strong> Create a vivid mental image or mini-story for each character. The more unusual or funny the story, the more memorable it is. For 看 (look), the top component resembles a hand (手) shading the eyes (目) — someone looking into the distance.</p>
    <p><strong>Spaced repetition:</strong> This is the single most effective technique for long-term retention. Review new characters after 1 day, then 3 days, then 1 week, then 2 weeks. Each successful review extends the interval.</p>
    <p><strong>Context learning:</strong> Learn characters as parts of words and sentences, not in isolation. Studying 学 in the context of 学生 (student), 学校 (school), and 学习 (study) creates multiple memory hooks.</p>
    <p><strong>Writing practice:</strong> Generate custom sheets with our <a href="/chinese/tools/practice-sheet/">Practice Sheet Generator</a>. Start with tracing the model character, then write independently.</p>

    <h2 id="daily-routine">Building a Daily Routine</h2>
    <p>Consistency beats intensity. A realistic daily routine might look like this:</p>
    <p><strong>Morning (5 min):</strong> Learn the <a href="/chinese/tools/daily-character/">Daily Character</a> — study its meaning, pronunciation, and example words.</p>
    <p><strong>Commute (10 min):</strong> Review yesterday's characters using flashcards or quiz yourself mentally.</p>
    <p><strong>Evening (15 min):</strong> Write practice — use <a href="/chinese/tools/practice-sheet/">practice sheets</a> for new characters and review old ones.</p>
    <p>That is just 30 minutes daily, but over a month it adds up to 15+ hours of focused practice and approximately 30-60 new characters learned with solid retention.</p>
