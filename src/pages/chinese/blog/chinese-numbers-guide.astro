    <h2 id="basics">Numbers 1-10</h2>
    <p>Chinese numbers 1-10 are single characters and the foundation for all counting: 一(yī) 二(èr) 三(sān) 四(sì) 五(wǔ) 六(liù) 七(qī) 八(bā) 九(jiǔ) 十(shí). Notice that 一, 二, 三 visually represent one, two, and three horizontal strokes.</p>

    <h2 id="larger">Building Larger Numbers</h2>
    <p>Chinese numbers follow a beautifully logical system. Eleven is simply "ten-one" (十一), twenty is "two-ten" (二十), and twenty-five is "two-ten-five" (二十五). Hundred is 百 (bǎi), thousand is 千 (qiān), and ten thousand is 万/萬 (wàn). Try our <a href="/chinese/tools/number-converter/">Number Converter</a> to see any number in Chinese.</p>

    <h2 id="lucky">Lucky and Unlucky Numbers</h2>
    <p>Number symbolism is deeply embedded in Chinese culture. <strong>8 (八, bā)</strong> is the luckiest number because it sounds like 发 (fā, prosperity). The 2008 Beijing Olympics started at 8:08 PM on 8/8/08. <strong>6 (六, liù)</strong> represents smooth sailing. <strong>9 (九, jiǔ)</strong> symbolizes longevity. Meanwhile, <strong>4 (四, sì)</strong> is avoided because it sounds like death.</p>
