    <h2 id="formal">Formal Greetings</h2>
    <p><strong>你好 (nǐ hǎo)</strong> remains the standard polite greeting, appropriate in most situations. For extra politeness, especially with elders or in formal contexts, use <strong>您好 (nín hǎo)</strong>, where 您 is the respectful form of "you."</p>
    <p><strong>很高兴认识你 (hěn gāoxìng rènshi nǐ)</strong> means "pleased to meet you" and is used during introductions. In business settings, people often exchange name cards while saying this phrase.</p>
    <p><strong>久仰大名 (jiǔ yǎng dà míng)</strong> is an elegant expression meaning "I have long admired your name." Used in formal introductions, it shows respect and cultural sophistication.</p>

    <h2 id="casual">Casual Greetings</h2>
    <p>Among friends, Chinese speakers often greet each other with practical questions rather than generic hellos. <strong>吃了吗 (chī le ma)</strong> — "Have you eaten?" — is one of the most traditional casual greetings, reflecting the cultural importance of meals.</p>
    <p><strong>最近怎么样 (zuìjìn zěnme yàng)</strong> means "How have things been lately?" and works well when you haven't seen someone in a while. The response is usually 还好 (hái hǎo, "pretty good") or 还行 (hái xíng, "not bad").</p>
    <p><strong>忙什么呢 (máng shénme ne)</strong> — "What are you busy with?" — is a common conversation opener that shows friendly interest.</p>

    <h2 id="time-based">Time-Based Greetings</h2>
    <p><strong>早上好 (zǎoshang hǎo)</strong> for good morning, <strong>下午好 (xiàwǔ hǎo)</strong> for good afternoon, and <strong>晚上好 (wǎnshang hǎo)</strong> for good evening. These are slightly more formal than casual greetings. For a quick informal morning greeting, just say <strong>早 (zǎo)</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>晚安 (wǎn'ān)</strong> means good night and is used when parting in the evening or before sleep.</p>

    <h2 id="phone">Phone and Business</h2>
    <p><strong>喂 (wéi)</strong> is the standard phone greeting — equivalent to "hello" when answering a call. In business contexts, <strong>你好，请问… (nǐ hǎo, qǐng wèn…)</strong> meaning "Hello, may I ask…" is a polite way to begin.</p>
