    <h2 id="tools">Essential Tools</h2>
    <p>The traditional calligraphy set includes the <strong>文房四宝 (wénfáng sì bǎo)</strong> — Four Treasures of the Study: brush (笔, bǐ), ink (墨, mò), paper (纸, zhǐ), and inkstone (砚, yàn). For beginners, a medium-sized wolf-hair brush and practice paper with grid guidelines are sufficient.</p>

    <h2 id="techniques">Basic Techniques</h2>
    <p>Hold the brush vertically, gripping it with three fingers near the middle. Keep your wrist elevated above the paper. Each stroke begins with a "hidden tip" entry — press then lift slightly to start the stroke cleanly. The key is controlling pressure: press harder for thick strokes, lighter for thin ones.</p>

    <h2 id="practice">Practice Path</h2>
    <p>Start with the eight basic strokes using the character 永 (yǒng, eternal). Then practice simple characters: 一, 二, 三, 人, 大, 天. Use our <a href="/chinese/tools/stroke-order/">Stroke Order tool</a> to learn correct sequences before writing with a brush. Generate <a href="/chinese/tools/practice-sheet/">practice sheets</a> for structured training.</p>
