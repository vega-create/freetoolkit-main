    <h2 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced Repetition</h2>
    <p>Spaced repetition is the single most effective vocabulary learning technique. Review new words after 1 day, then 3 days, then 7 days, then 14 days. Each successful recall extends the interval. This leverages how human memory naturally consolidates information. Our <a href="/chinese/tools/daily-character/">Daily Character</a> tool builds this habit automatically.</p>

    <h2 id="context">Context-Based Learning</h2>
    <p>Never learn words in isolation. Study 学 as part of 学生 (student), 学校 (school), 学习 (study) — seeing a character in multiple words creates stronger neural connections than flashcard drilling.</p>

    <h2 id="mnemonics">Mnemonics and Stories</h2>
    <p>Create vivid, unusual stories to link characters to meanings. The character 休 (rest) shows a person (人) leaning against a tree (木). These visual mnemonics exploit your brain's preference for narrative and imagery over abstract symbol-meaning pairs.</p>

    <h2 id="active">Active Recall Testing</h2>
    <p>Testing yourself is more effective than re-reading. Use our <a href="/chinese/tools/hsk-vocabulary/">HSK Vocabulary Browser</a> to study, then quiz yourself by covering the English meaning and trying to recall it. Active recall strengthens memory traces far more than passive review.</p>
