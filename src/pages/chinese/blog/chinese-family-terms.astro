    <h2 id="immediate">Immediate Family</h2>
    <p><strong>爸爸 (bàba)</strong> dad, <strong>妈妈 (māma)</strong> mom, <strong>哥哥 (gēge)</strong> older brother, <strong>姐姐 (jiějie)</strong> older sister, <strong>弟弟 (dìdi)</strong> younger brother, <strong>妹妹 (mèimei)</strong> younger sister. Notice that Chinese distinguishes older vs younger siblings with different words — there is no generic word for "brother" or "sister."</p>

    <h2 id="extended">Extended Family</h2>
    <p>Grandparents on the father's side: <strong>爷爷 (yéye)</strong> paternal grandfather, <strong>奶奶 (nǎinai)</strong> paternal grandmother. On the mother's side: <strong>外公 (wàigōng)</strong> maternal grandfather, <strong>外婆 (wàipó)</strong> maternal grandmother. The 外 prefix literally means "outside," reflecting the traditional view of the maternal family line.</p>

    <h2 id="paternal-maternal">Paternal vs Maternal</h2>
    <p>Father's brother is 伯伯 (bóbo, if older) or 叔叔 (shūshu, if younger). Mother's brother is 舅舅 (jiùjiu). Father's sister is 姑姑 (gūgu). Mother's sister is 阿姨 (āyí). This precision means you always know the exact relationship when someone mentions a family member. Practice these characters with our <a href="/chinese/tools/daily-character/">Daily Character</a> tool.</p>
