    <h2 id="name-structure">Chinese Name Structure</h2>
    <p>Chinese names follow a <strong>family name + given name</strong> order — the opposite of most Western conventions. The family name (姓, xìng) comes first, followed by the given name (名, míng). So in the name 王小明 (Wáng Xiǎomíng), 王 is the family name and 小明 is the given name.</p>
    <p>Family names are almost always one character (rarely two, like 欧阳/歐陽 or 司马/司馬). Given names can be one or two characters. Two-character given names are more common in modern China and Taiwan.</p>
    <p>This means most Chinese names are either two characters (one-character given name) or three characters (two-character given name) long. A Chinese person's full name is remarkably concise.</p>

    <h2 id="choosing-characters">How Characters Are Chosen</h2>
    <p>Unlike many Western names that are chosen from a fixed set of traditional names, Chinese given names are <strong>composed from scratch</strong> by parents. They select characters based on:</p>
    <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Parents choose characters with positive, aspirational meanings. Popular elements include 文 (cultured), 明 (bright), 美 (beautiful), 强 (strong), 慧 (wise), and 安 (peaceful).</p>
    <p><strong>Sound:</strong> The name should sound pleasant when spoken aloud. Parents consider how the characters sound together and whether the tones flow naturally.</p>
    <p><strong>Balance:</strong> In traditional Chinese philosophy, names should balance the five elements (metal, wood, water, fire, earth). Some families consult fortune tellers to ensure harmonious stroke counts and element balance.</p>
    <p><strong>Generational markers:</strong> Some families use a shared character across siblings or all members of a generation. For example, all children in one generation might share the character 国.</p>

    <h2 id="cultural-traditions">Cultural Naming Traditions</h2>
    <p>Chinese naming carries significant cultural weight. Several traditions and taboos exist:</p>
    <p><strong>Avoid repeating elders' names:</strong> Traditionally, using the same character as a parent, grandparent, or respected elder is considered disrespectful. This means each generation in a family typically has unique name characters.</p>
    <p><strong>Gender patterns:</strong> While not strict rules, certain characters lean masculine (强 strong, 龙 dragon, 刚 firm) or feminine (花 flower, 美 beautiful, 婷 graceful). Modern parents increasingly choose gender-neutral characters.</p>
    <p><strong>Lucky numbers:</strong> The total stroke count of a name may be considered. Certain numbers are seen as auspicious.</p>
    <p><strong>Name changes:</strong> In Chinese culture, changing one's name is not uncommon. People may adopt new names for business, when moving abroad, or after consulting a fortune teller.</p>

    <h2 id="create-your-name">Creating Your Chinese Name</h2>
    <p>If you are learning Chinese, having a Chinese name makes introductions smoother and shows cultural appreciation. There are two main approaches:</p>
    <p><strong>Phonetic translation:</strong> Choose characters that approximate the sound of your original name. For example, "David" might become 大卫/大衛 (Dàwèi). This approach maintains a connection to your original name.</p>
    <p><strong>Meaningful selection:</strong> Choose characters based entirely on meaning, creating a name that sounds naturally Chinese. This approach often produces more elegant results but has no connection to your original name.</p>
