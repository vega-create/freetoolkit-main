    <h2 id="clock">Clock Time</h2>
    <p>Chinese clock time uses <strong>点 (diǎn)</strong> for hours and <strong>分 (fēn)</strong> for minutes. Three o'clock is 三点 (sān diǎn). 3:30 is 三点半 (sān diǎn bàn, using 半 for half) or 三点三十分. A quarter is 刻 (kè), so 3:15 is 三点一刻.</p>

    <h2 id="days">Days and Weeks</h2>
    <p>Days of the week follow an elegant number pattern. 星期一 (Monday, literally "week-one") through 星期六 (Saturday, "week-six"). Only Sunday breaks the pattern: 星期天 or 星期日. Today is 今天 (jīntiān), yesterday is 昨天 (zuótiān), tomorrow is 明天 (míngtiān).</p>

    <h2 id="months">Months and Years</h2>
    <p>Months are simply number + 月: 一月 (January), 二月 (February), and so on through 十二月 (December). Years are read digit by digit: 2026 is 二零二六年. This system is remarkably logical compared to English month names. Try our <a href="/chinese/tools/number-converter/">Number Converter</a> to practice numbers.</p>
