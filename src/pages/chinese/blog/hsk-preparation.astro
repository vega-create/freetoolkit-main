    <h2 id="hsk-overview">HSK Overview: Levels and Requirements</h2>
    <p>The HSK exam measures Chinese language proficiency across six levels. Each level has specific vocabulary, grammar, and skill requirements:</p>
    <p><strong>HSK 1:</strong> 150 words, 174 characters. Can understand simple phrases. <strong>HSK 2:</strong> 300 words, 347 characters. Can handle basic daily communication. <strong>HSK 3:</strong> 600 words, 617 characters. Can communicate in daily, academic, and professional situations at a basic level. <strong>HSK 4:</strong> 1,200 words. Can discuss a wide range of topics fluently. <strong>HSK 5:</strong> 2,500 words. Can read Chinese newspapers and magazines. <strong>HSK 6:</strong> 5,000+ words. Can express oneself fluently in speech and writing.</p>
    <p>The exam includes listening, reading, and (from HSK 3) writing sections. There is no speaking component in the standard HSK, though a separate HSKK (oral) exam exists.</p>

    <h2 id="hsk-1-2">HSK 1-2: Building the Foundation</h2>
    <p><strong>Focus areas:</strong> Pinyin pronunciation, basic character recognition, core vocabulary, simple sentence patterns.</p>
    <p>At this stage, your priority is developing a solid phonetic foundation. Make sure you can distinguish all four tones and pronounce the tricky initials (zh, ch, sh, j, q, x) before rushing into vocabulary. Use our <a href="/chinese/tools/tone-trainer/">Tone Trainer</a> for daily practice.</p>
    <p>For vocabulary, learn words in context rather than isolation. Study common phrases and short dialogues. Our <a href="/chinese/tools/hsk-vocabulary/">HSK Vocabulary Browser</a> lets you review words organized by level.</p>

    <h2 id="hsk-3-4">HSK 3-4: Reaching Intermediate</h2>
    <p><strong>Focus areas:</strong> Grammar structures, reading comprehension, writing basic compositions, expanding vocabulary beyond survival Chinese.</p>
    <p>HSK 3-4 is where many learners hit a plateau. The grammar becomes more nuanced (measure words, aspect particles, complement structures), and you need to start reading longer texts.</p>
    <p>Key strategies for this level include: reading graded readers or simplified news articles, practicing writing short essays or diary entries, watching Chinese content with subtitles, and engaging with native speakers.</p>

    <h2 id="study-strategies">Effective Study Strategies</h2>
    <p><strong>Spaced repetition:</strong> Review vocabulary at increasing intervals to move words from short-term to long-term memory. Apps and flashcard systems use this principle.</p>
    <p><strong>Active recall:</strong> Test yourself rather than passively reviewing. Use our <a href="/chinese/tools/pinyin-quiz/">Pinyin Quiz</a> and <a href="/chinese/tools/measure-word/">Measure Word Practice</a> for active testing.</p>
    <p><strong>Immersion time:</strong> Dedicate time to Chinese media — podcasts, shows, music, news. Even 15 minutes daily helps your brain absorb natural patterns.</p>
    <p><strong>Writing practice:</strong> Hand-write characters regularly. This reinforces recognition and helps with the writing section. Use our <a href="/chinese/tools/practice-sheet/">Practice Sheet Generator</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="free-resources">Free Practice Resources</h2>
    <p>Our site offers several free resources to support your HSK preparation: the <a href="/chinese/tools/hsk-vocabulary/">HSK Vocabulary Browser</a> for word study, the <a href="/chinese/tools/pinyin-quiz/">Pinyin Quiz</a> for testing by level, downloadable <a href="/chinese/downloads/">HSK word list PDFs</a>, and the <a href="/chinese/tools/daily-character/">Daily Character</a> for consistent daily learning.</p>
