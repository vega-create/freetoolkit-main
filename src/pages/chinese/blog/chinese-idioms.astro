    <h2 id="what-are-chengyu">What Are Chengyu?</h2>
    <p>Chengyu (成语) are fixed four-character expressions that originate from classical Chinese literature, historical events, and ancient fables. With over 5,000 commonly used chengyu and perhaps 20,000 in total, they represent one of the richest aspects of the Chinese language.</p>
    <p>Each chengyu packs a complete idea into just four characters. Their compact form and cultural depth make them prized in both spoken conversation and formal writing. Using them appropriately signals a deeper understanding of Chinese language and culture.</p>
    <p>Most chengyu have a story behind them — a historical event, a fable, or a philosophical lesson. Understanding these stories makes the idioms easier to remember and more meaningful to use.</p>

    <h2 id="essential-chengyu">Essential Chengyu to Know</h2>
    <p><strong>画龙点睛 (huà lóng diǎn jīng)</strong> — "Paint a dragon, dot its eyes." Meaning: add the finishing touch that brings something to life. Legend says painter Zhang Sengyou drew four dragons without eyes. When he dotted two with eyes, they flew away. Use it when someone adds the perfect final detail to a project or work.</p>
    <p><strong>入乡随俗 (rù xiāng suí sú)</strong> — "Enter a village, follow its customs." The Chinese equivalent of "When in Rome, do as the Romans do." This idiom teaches respect for local cultures when visiting new places.</p>
    <p><strong>塞翁失马 (sài wēng shī mǎ)</strong> — "The old man on the frontier lost his horse." Meaning: a blessing in disguise. The story tells of an old man whose escaped horse returned with a wild stallion, whose son then broke his leg riding it, but was consequently exempt from military service. What seems bad may turn out well.</p>
    <p><strong>守株待兔 (shǒu zhū dài tù)</strong> — "Guard a tree stump, waiting for rabbits." A farmer once saw a rabbit crash into a tree stump and die. He then sat by the stump every day hoping for another. It means waiting passively for good fortune instead of taking action.</p>
    <p><strong>亡羊补牢 (wáng yáng bǔ láo)</strong> — "Mend the fence after losing sheep." The Chinese way of saying "better late than never." Even if a problem has already occurred, taking corrective action is still worthwhile.</p>

    <h2 id="how-to-learn">How to Learn and Use Chengyu</h2>
    <p><strong>Start with the stories.</strong> The origin tales make chengyu memorable. When you know why an idiom exists, you naturally remember what it means.</p>
    <p><strong>Learn in pairs.</strong> Some chengyu have natural opposites. Learning them together reinforces both.</p>
    <p><strong>Listen for them.</strong> Once you know a few chengyu, you will start hearing them in Chinese media. This real-world exposure solidifies your understanding of how they are actually used.</p>
    <p><strong>Use them sparingly.</strong> In conversation, one or two well-placed chengyu are impressive. Overusing them sounds forced. In formal writing, they are more common.</p>
