<h2 id="pricing">Asking About Prices</h2><p><strong>多少钱？(duōshǎo qián?)</strong> How much? <strong>太贵了 (tài guì le)</strong> Too expensive. <strong>便宜一点 (piányi yīdiǎn)</strong> A little cheaper please. Use our <a href="/chinese/tools/number-converter/">Number Converter</a> to understand Chinese number amounts.</p>
    <h2 id="bargaining">Bargaining Phrases</h2><p><strong>可以便宜吗？(kěyǐ piányi ma?)</strong> Can you make it cheaper? <strong>打折吗？(dǎzhé ma?)</strong> Is there a discount? <strong>最低多少？(zuìdī duōshǎo?)</strong> What's your lowest price? Start by offering about 50-60% of the asking price and negotiate from there.</p>
    <h2 id="payment">Payment</h2><p><strong>现金 (xiànjīn)</strong> cash. <strong>刷卡 (shuākǎ)</strong> credit card. <strong>微信支付 (wēixìn zhīfù)</strong> WeChat Pay. <strong>支付宝 (zhīfùbǎo)</strong> Alipay. Mobile payment is nearly universal in China — even street vendors accept it.</p>
