    <h2 id="question-words">The Core Question Words</h2>
    <p><strong>谁 (shéi)</strong> who, <strong>什么 (shénme)</strong> what, <strong>哪里 (nǎlǐ)</strong> where, <strong>什么时候 (shénme shíhou)</strong> when, <strong>为什么 (wèi shénme)</strong> why, <strong>怎么 (zěnme)</strong> how, <strong>多少 (duōshǎo)</strong> how many/much, <strong>几 (jǐ)</strong> how many (small number).</p>

    <h2 id="patterns">Question Patterns</h2>
    <p>In Chinese, questions are formed three ways. First, the <strong>ma (吗) pattern</strong>: add 吗 to any statement to make it a yes/no question. Second, the <strong>question word pattern</strong>: place the question word where the answer goes. Third, the <strong>verb-not-verb pattern</strong>: 你去不去？(Do you go or not go?).</p>

    <h2 id="examples">Practice Examples</h2>
    <p>你叫什么名字？(What is your name?) 你从哪里来？(Where are you from?) 这个多少钱？(How much is this?) 你为什么学中文？(Why are you learning Chinese?). Practice recognizing these patterns with our <a href="/chinese/tools/pinyin-quiz/">Pinyin Quiz</a>.</p>
