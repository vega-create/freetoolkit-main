    <h2 id="svo">Basic SVO Structure</h2>
    <p>Like English, Chinese follows a <strong>Subject-Verb-Object</strong> order for basic sentences. 我吃饭 (wǒ chī fàn) literally translates as "I eat rice" — the structure maps directly to English.</p>
    <p>Negation is straightforward: place 不 (bù) or 没 (méi) before the verb. 我不吃 (I don't eat), 他没来 (He didn't come). Use 不 for habitual negation and 没 for past events.</p>

    <h2 id="time-place">Time and Place Rules</h2>
    <p>One key difference from English: <strong>time and place come before the verb</strong> in Chinese. The pattern is: Subject + Time + Place + Verb + Object. So "I eat at school tomorrow" becomes 我明天在学校吃饭 — literally "I tomorrow at school eat rice."</p>
    <p>This STPVO pattern feels unusual at first, but it follows a logical principle: set the context (when and where) before describing the action.</p>

    <h2 id="questions">Forming Questions</h2>
    <p>Chinese has several question-forming strategies. The simplest is adding 吗 (ma) to any statement: 你好 → 你好吗？(Are you well?). For choice questions, use the verb-not-verb pattern: 你去不去？(Are you going or not?). Question words like 什么 (what), 哪里 (where), and 谁 (who) stay in the position where the answer would go, unlike English which moves them to the front.</p>
