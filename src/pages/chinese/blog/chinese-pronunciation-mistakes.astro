    <h2 id="tone-errors">Tone Errors</h2>
    <p><strong>Flat-lining tones:</strong> Speaking all syllables at the same pitch. Fix: exaggerate tones initially, then reduce to natural levels. <strong>English intonation override:</strong> Rising pitch at sentence end for questions, conflicting with Chinese tones. Fix: practice sentences where the final character has a falling tone. Use our <a href="/chinese/tools/tone-trainer/">Tone Trainer</a> for daily tone practice.</p>

    <h2 id="initial-errors">Initial Sound Errors</h2>
    <p><strong>Confusing zh/j and ch/q:</strong> These sound similar but are produced at different positions in the mouth. zh/ch/sh are retroflex (tongue curled back), while j/q/x are palatal (tongue against hard palate). <strong>Pronouncing x as "ks":</strong> Chinese x sounds like a sharp "sh" — it has nothing to do with the English letter x.</p>

    <h2 id="final-errors">Final Sound Errors</h2>
    <p><strong>Mixing up -an and -ang:</strong> The -an ending has a front nasal (tongue touches teeth ridge), while -ang has a back nasal (sound resonates in the back). <strong>Mispronouncing ü:</strong> This sound doesn't exist in English. Say "ee" while rounding your lips like "oo." Check any pronunciation with our <a href="/chinese/tools/pinyin-converter/">Pinyin Converter</a>.</p>
