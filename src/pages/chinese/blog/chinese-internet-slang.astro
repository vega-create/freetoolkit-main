    <p>Chinese internet culture uses numbers as homophones. <strong>520 (wǔ èr líng)</strong> sounds like 我爱你 (wǒ ài nǐ, I love you). <strong>666 (liù liù liù)</strong> means awesome or impressive (from gaming culture). <strong>88 (bā bā)</strong> sounds like "bye-bye." <strong>233</strong> means laughing hard, originating from an emoticon code on a Chinese forum.</p>

    <h2 id="abbreviations">Character Abbreviations</h2>
    <p><strong>yyds</strong> — 永远的神 (yǒngyuǎn de shén), meaning "eternal god" or greatest of all time. <strong>xswl</strong> — 笑死我了 (xiào sǐ wǒ le), laughing to death. <strong>awsl</strong> — 啊我死了 (a wǒ sǐ le), expressing extreme cuteness overload. These pinyin abbreviations save typing time.</p>
