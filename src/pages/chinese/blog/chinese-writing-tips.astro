    <h2 id="basic-strokes">The 8 Basic Strokes</h2>
    <p>Every Chinese character is built from combinations of 8 basic stroke types: <strong>横 (héng)</strong> horizontal, <strong>竖 (shù)</strong> vertical, <strong>撇 (piě)</strong> left-falling, <strong>捺 (nà)</strong> right-falling, <strong>点 (diǎn)</strong> dot, <strong>折 (zhé)</strong> turning, <strong>钩 (gōu)</strong> hook, and <strong>提 (tí)</strong> rising. The character 永 (yǒng, eternal) famously contains all eight basic strokes.</p>

    <h2 id="order-rules">Stroke Order Rules</h2>
    <p>Six main rules govern stroke order: top before bottom (三: three horizontal strokes, top to bottom), left before right (川: three vertical strokes, left to right), horizontal before vertical (十: horizontal first, then vertical), outside before inside (回: outer square first), close last (国: closing bottom stroke last), and center before sides in symmetrical characters (小: center vertical first).</p>

    <h2 id="practice">Practice Tips</h2>
    <p>Use our <a href="/chinese/tools/stroke-order/">Stroke Order tool</a> to see animated stroke sequences. Generate custom <a href="/chinese/tools/practice-sheet/">practice sheets</a> for the characters you are learning. Start with simple characters (一二三人大) and gradually work up to complex ones. Even 10 minutes of daily handwriting practice builds lasting muscle memory.</p>
