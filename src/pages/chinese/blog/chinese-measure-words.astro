    <h2 id="what-are-measure-words">What Are Measure Words?</h2>
    <p>In English, we sometimes use special words between numbers and nouns: "a <em>piece</em> of paper," "two <em>cups</em> of coffee," "a <em>pair</em> of shoes." Chinese does this with <strong>every noun</strong>, using words called measure words or classifiers (量词, liàngcí).</p>
    <p>The basic structure is: <strong>Number + Measure Word + Noun</strong>. So "one book" becomes 一本书 (yī běn shū), where 本 (běn) is the measure word specifically for books and bound items.</p>
    <p>Using the wrong measure word is a common mistake for learners, but it rarely causes misunderstanding. Think of it like saying "a piece of book" in English — it sounds odd but the meaning is clear. Still, using correct measure words marks the difference between basic and natural-sounding Chinese.</p>

    <h2 id="essential-12">The 12 Most Essential Measure Words</h2>
    <p><strong>个 (gè)</strong> — The universal measure word. Works for people, general objects, and as a fallback when you do not know the specific one: 一个人 (a person), 一个苹果 (an apple).</p>
    <p><strong>本 (běn)</strong> — Books, magazines, dictionaries: 一本书 (a book), 三本杂志 (three magazines).</p>
    <p><strong>杯 (bēi)</strong> — Cups and glasses of liquid: 一杯水 (a glass of water), 两杯咖啡 (two cups of coffee).</p>
    <p><strong>只 (zhī)</strong> — Small animals: 一只猫 (a cat), 两只鸟 (two birds).</p>
    <p><strong>条 (tiáo)</strong> — Long thin things, fish, roads, pants: 一条鱼 (a fish), 一条路 (a road).</p>
    <p><strong>张 (zhāng)</strong> — Flat things like paper, tables, photos: 一张纸 (a sheet of paper), 一张桌子 (a table).</p>
    <p><strong>件 (jiàn)</strong> — Clothing (upper body) and matters: 一件衣服 (a piece of clothing), 一件事 (a matter).</p>
    <p><strong>辆 (liàng)</strong> — Vehicles: 一辆车 (a car), 两辆自行车 (two bicycles).</p>
    <p><strong>双 (shuāng)</strong> — Pairs: 一双鞋 (a pair of shoes), 一双筷子 (a pair of chopsticks).</p>
    <p><strong>瓶 (píng)</strong> — Bottles: 一瓶水 (a bottle of water).</p>
    <p><strong>块 (kuài)</strong> — Pieces, chunks, and money colloquially: 一块蛋糕 (a piece of cake), 十块钱 (ten yuan).</p>
    <p><strong>位 (wèi)</strong> — People (polite form): 一位老师 (a teacher), 两位客人 (two guests).</p>

    <h2 id="rules-and-tips">Rules and Tips</h2>
    <p><strong>Demonstratives need measure words too.</strong> When using "this" or "that," include the measure word: 这本书 (this book), 那只猫 (that cat).</p>
    <p><strong>Look for patterns.</strong> Measure words often relate to shape or category: 条 (tiáo) for long things, 张 (zhāng) for flat things, 块 (kuài) for chunk-shaped things.</p>
