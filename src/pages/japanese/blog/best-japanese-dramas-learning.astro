    <h2 id="why-dramas">Why Dramas Work</h2>
    <p>Effective Japanese study is about working smarter, not harder. Research consistently shows that certain approaches dramatically outperform traditional study methods.</p>
    <p>This section covers the fundamentals that every learner needs to understand. Take your time with these concepts — they form the foundation for everything that follows.</p>
    <h2 id="beginner">Beginner Dramas (5)</h2>
    <p>This is a critical area that many learners underestimate. Understanding these patterns and concepts will significantly accelerate your progress and help you avoid common plateaus.</p>
    <p>Focus on recognizing these elements in real Japanese content — news articles, manga, conversations, and social media. Active recognition in context is far more effective than passive memorization.</p>

    <h2 id="study-method">How to Study with Dramas</h2>
    <p>The spacing effect — reviewing at gradually increasing intervals — and active recall — retrieving information from memory rather than re-reading — are two of the most powerful evidence-based techniques for language learning.</p>
    <p>Consistency beats intensity. Studying 15 minutes daily produces better results than 2 hours once a week. Build Japanese into your daily routine rather than treating it as a separate activity.
