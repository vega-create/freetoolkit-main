    <h2 id="general">The General Counter つ</h2>
    <p>The safest counter for beginners is つ (tsu), which uses native Japanese numbers: ひとつ (1), ふたつ (2), みっつ (3), よっつ (4), いつつ (5), むっつ (6), ななつ (7), やっつ (8), ここのつ (9), とお (10). This works for almost any countable object and is never wrong.</p>

    <h2 id="essential">Essential Counters</h2>
    <p><strong>人 (nin/ri)</strong> for people — note the irregular ひとり (1) and ふたり (2). <strong>本 (hon)</strong> for long thin objects: pens, bottles, umbrellas, trees. <strong>枚 (mai)</strong> for flat things: paper, tickets, shirts, plates. <strong>匹 (hiki)</strong> for small animals. <strong>杯 (hai)</strong> for cups and glasses of liquid. <strong>台 (dai)</strong> for machines and vehicles.</p>
    <p>Practice all these counters with audio in our <a href="/japanese/tools/counter-practice/">Counter Practice</a> tool.</p>

    <h2 id="sound-changes">Sound Changes</h2>
    <p>Numbers 1, 3, 6, 8, and 10 often trigger sound changes when combined with counters. For 本: いっぽん (1), さんぼん (3), ろっぽん (6), はっぽん (8), じゅっぽん (10). These changes follow patterns — h→p after 1/6/8/10, h→b after 3. Learning these patterns saves memorizing each counter individually. Convert any number with our <a href="/japanese/tools/number-converter/">Number Converter</a>.</p>
