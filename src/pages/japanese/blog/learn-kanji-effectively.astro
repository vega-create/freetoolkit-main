    <h2 id="radicals">Learning Through Radicals</h2>
    <p>Kanji are built from smaller components called radicals. Learning these building blocks lets you decompose complex kanji into familiar parts. For example, 休 (rest) combines 人 (person) and 木 (tree) — a person resting against a tree. The character 明 (bright) combines 日 (sun) and 月 (moon) — sun and moon together mean bright.</p>
    <p>Use our <a href="/japanese/tools/kanji-lookup/">Kanji Lookup</a> to explore kanji components and find connections between characters.</p>

    <h2 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced Repetition</h2>
    <p>Spaced repetition is the most scientifically supported method for long-term memorization. Review kanji at increasing intervals: after 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days. Each successful recall strengthens the memory trace. Our <a href="/japanese/tools/daily-kanji/">Daily Kanji</a> tool builds this habit with one new kanji each day.</p>

    <h2 id="context">Learning in Context</h2>
    <p>Never learn kanji in isolation. Study each kanji as part of vocabulary words: learn 食 through 食べる (to eat), 食事 (meal), 和食 (Japanese food). This gives you both kanji recognition and useful vocabulary simultaneously. Generate writing <a href="/japanese/tools/practice-sheet/">practice sheets</a> for the kanji you're currently studying.</p>
