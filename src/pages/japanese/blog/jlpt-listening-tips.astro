    <h2 id="section-types">Listening Section Types</h2>
    <p>Preparing effectively for the JLPT requires understanding both the content and the test format. This guide covers the essential knowledge you need along with practical strategies for maximizing your score.</p>
    <p>This section covers the fundamentals that every learner needs to understand. Take your time with these concepts — they form the foundation for everything that follows.</p>
    <h2 id="note-taking">Note-Taking Strategy</h2>
    <p>This is a critical area that many learners underestimate. Understanding these patterns and concepts will significantly accelerate your progress and help you avoid common plateaus.</p>
    <p>Focus on recognizing these elements in real Japanese content — news articles, manga, conversations, and social media. Active recognition in context is far more effective than passive memorization.</p>

    <h2 id="daily-plan">Daily Listening Practice</h2>
    <p>The key to JLPT success is combining systematic study with regular practice using authentic materials. Past exam questions are your most valuable resource — work through at least 3-5 full practice tests before your exam date.</p>
    <p>Beyond the exam, the skills you develop through JLPT preparation — reading comprehension, listening strategies, grammar analysis — transfer directly to real-world Japanese use.
