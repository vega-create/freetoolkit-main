    <h2 id="greetings">Greetings and Bowing</h2>
    <p>Bowing (お辞儀, ojigi) is the standard greeting in Japan. The depth and duration convey the level of respect. In casual situations, a slight head nod suffices. In business, a 30-degree bow is standard. When meeting someone for the first time, say はじめまして (hajimemashite, nice to meet you) followed by your name and よろしくお願いします (yoroshiku onegaishimasu).</p>

    <h2 id="dining">Dining Etiquette</h2>
    <p>Say いただきます (itadakimasu, I humbly receive) before eating and ごちそうさまでした (gochisousama deshita, thank you for the meal) after. Never stick chopsticks upright in rice — this resembles funeral incense. Don't pass food chopstick-to-chopstick (another funeral association). Slurping noodles is not only acceptable but shows appreciation.</p>

    <h2 id="social">Social Norms</h2>
    <p>Remove shoes when entering homes, traditional restaurants, and some businesses — look for a raised entryway (genkan). Keep your voice low on public transportation. Tipping is not practiced and can cause confusion. When receiving a business card, accept it with both hands and read it before putting it away — never write on it in front of the giver.</p>
