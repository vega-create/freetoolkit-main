    <h2 id="when-used">When is Katakana Used?</h2>
    <p>Katakana serves several specific purposes in Japanese writing. Its primary use is for foreign loanwords: コーヒー (koohii, coffee), レストラン (resutoran, restaurant), パソコン (pasokon, personal computer). It is also used for foreign personal and place names, onomatopoeia, scientific terminology, and occasionally for emphasis.</p>
    <p>In modern Japan, katakana words are everywhere — menus, advertisements, technology, fashion. Learning katakana unlocks a huge vocabulary of words borrowed from English and other languages.</p>

    <h2 id="confusing-pairs">Confusing Pairs</h2>
    <p>Several katakana characters look remarkably similar and trip up beginners. The most infamous pairs: <strong>シ (shi) vs ツ (tsu)</strong> — look at stroke angle; シ strokes are more horizontal while ツ strokes are more vertical. <strong>ソ (so) vs ン (n)</strong> — similar distinction in stroke direction. <strong>ウ (u) vs フ (fu)</strong> — ウ has a top stroke that フ lacks.</p>
    <p>Practice these confusing pairs specifically with our <a href="/japanese/tools/katakana-quiz/">Katakana Quiz</a> until they become automatic.</p>

    <h2 id="loanwords">Reading Loanwords</h2>
    <p>Japanese adapts foreign words to fit its sound system, so they may not be immediately recognizable. The key is to read them aloud at natural speed: テレビ (te-re-bi → television), アイスクリーム (a-i-su-ku-rii-mu → ice cream), チョコレート (cho-ko-ree-to → chocolate). Once you hear the rhythm, the English origin becomes clear.</p>
