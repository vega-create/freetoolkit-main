    <h2 id="three-types">The Three Types of Keigo</h2>
    <p><strong>丁寧語 (teineigo)</strong> — polite language using です and ます. This is the baseline level of politeness most learners already know. <strong>尊敬語 (sonkeigo)</strong> — respectful language that elevates the actions of others: いらっしゃる (to be/go, respectful), ご覧になる (to see, respectful). <strong>謙譲語 (kenjougo)</strong> — humble language that lowers your own actions: 参る (to go, humble), 拝見する (to see, humble).</p>

    <h2 id="daily-keigo">Daily Keigo Phrases</h2>
    <p>You encounter keigo daily in Japan. Shop staff say いらっしゃいませ (welcome). Restaurants ask 何名様ですか (how many guests). Business emails use お忙しいところ恐れ入りますが (I'm sorry to bother you while you're busy). Learn essential polite phrases with our <a href="/japanese/tools/daily-phrase/">Daily Phrase</a> tool.</p>

    <h2 id="mistakes">Common Keigo Mistakes</h2>
    <p>The biggest mistake is using sonkeigo for your own actions — elevating yourself is the opposite of the intention. Another common error is mixing keigo levels inappropriately, such as using very formal language with friends (which feels cold and distant) or casual language with superiors. Start with mastering teineigo (です/ます), then gradually add sonkeigo and kenjougo phrases as you encounter them.</p>
