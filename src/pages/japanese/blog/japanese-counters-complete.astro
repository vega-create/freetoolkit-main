Counters specify the type and quantity of what you are counting, similar to English 'a sheet of paper' or 'a head of cattle.'"}, {"q": "What if I use the wrong counter?", "a": "Using the generic counter つ (hitotsu, futatsu...) is always acceptable. Japanese people will understand you even with the wrong specific counter."}, {"q": "How many counters do I need to know?", "a": "About 10-15 common counters cover 90 percent of daily situations. There are hundreds of specialized counters, but most Japanese people only use 20-30 regularly."}];

    <h2 id="why-counters">Why Counters Exist</h2>
    <p>Preparing effectively for the JLPT requires understanding both the content and the test format. This guide covers the essential knowledge you need along with practical strategies for maximizing your score.</p>
    <p>This section covers the fundamentals that every learner needs to understand. Take your time with these concepts — they form the foundation for everything that follows.</p>
    <h2 id="essential-10">10 Essential Counters</h2>
    <p>This is a critical area that many learners underestimate. Understanding these patterns and concepts will significantly accelerate your progress and help you avoid common plateaus.</p>
    <p>Focus on recognizing these elements in real Japanese content — news articles, manga, conversations, and social media. Active recognition in context is far more effective than passive memorization.</p>
    <h2 id="sound-changes">Sound Change Rules</h2>

    <h2 id="practice">Practice Exercises</h2>
    <p>The key to JLPT success is combining systematic study with regular practice using authentic materials. Past exam questions are your most valuable resource — work through at least 3-5 full practice tests before your exam date.</p>
    <p>Beyond the exam, the skills you develop through JLPT preparation — reading comprehension, listening strategies, grammar analysis — transfer directly to real-world Japanese use. Practice with <a href="/japanese/tools/jlpt-vocabulary/">JLPT Vocabulary</a> and <a href="/japanese/tools/number-converter/">Number Converter</a> to reinforce what you have learned.</p>
