    <p>Language and culture are inseparable in Japanese. Understanding the cultural context behind words and phrases transforms your communication from technically correct to genuinely appropriate.</p>

    <p>Japanese communication reflects core cultural values: respect for hierarchy, consideration for others' feelings, and careful attention to context. When you understand these values, language patterns that seemed arbitrary suddenly make perfect sense.</p>
    <p>Immerse yourself in authentic Japanese media to observe how native speakers adjust their language across different social contexts. This builds cultural intuition far more effectively than memorizing rules from a textbook.
