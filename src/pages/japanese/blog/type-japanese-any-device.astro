Kana input uses a Japanese keyboard layout. Romaji input is recommended for learners."}, {"q": "How do I type kanji?", "a": "Type the reading in hiragana, then press space to see kanji candidates. Select the correct one and press enter. The system learns your preferences over time."}, {"q": "Can I handwrite Japanese on my phone?", "a": "Yes — both iOS and Android support handwriting input for Japanese. It is useful for looking up unknown kanji by drawing them."}];

    <h2 id="why-type">Why Learn to Type Japanese</h2>
    <p>Effective Japanese study is about working smarter, not harder. Research consistently shows that certain approaches dramatically outperform traditional study methods.</p>
    <p>This section covers the fundamentals that every learner needs to understand. Take your time with these concepts — they form the foundation for everything that follows.</p>
    <h2 id="iphone">iPhone and iPad Setup</h2>
    <p>This is a critical area that many learners underestimate. Understanding these patterns and concepts will significantly accelerate your progress and help you avoid common plateaus.</p>
    <p>Focus on recognizing these elements in real Japanese content — news articles, manga, conversations, and social media. Active recognition in context is far more effective than passive memorization.</p>

    <p>The spacing effect — reviewing at gradually increasing intervals — and active recall — retrieving information from memory rather than re-reading — are two of the most powerful evidence-based techniques for language learning.</p>
    <p>Consistency beats intensity. Studying 15 minutes daily produces better results than 2 hours once a week. Build Japanese into your daily routine rather than treating it as a separate activity. Practice with <a href="/japanese/tools/hiragana-chart/">Hiragana Chart</a> and <a href="/japanese/tools/katakana-chart/">Katakana Chart</a> to reinforce what you have learned.</p>
