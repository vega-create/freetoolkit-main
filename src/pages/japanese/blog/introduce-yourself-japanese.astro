    <h2 id="what-is">What is Jikoshoukai?</h2>
    <p>Language and culture are inseparable in Japanese. Understanding the cultural context behind words and phrases transforms your communication from technically correct to genuinely appropriate.</p>
    <p>This section covers the fundamentals that every learner needs to understand. Take your time with these concepts — they form the foundation for everything that follows.</p>
    <h2 id="casual">Casual Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is a critical area that many learners underestimate. Understanding these patterns and concepts will significantly accelerate your progress and help you avoid common plateaus.</p>
    <p>Focus on recognizing these elements in real Japanese content — news articles, manga, conversations, and social media. Active recognition in context is far more effective than passive memorization.</p>
    <h2 id="formal">Formal Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is a critical area that many learners underestimate. Understanding these patterns and concepts will significantly accelerate your progress and help you avoid common plateaus.</p>

    <h2 id="templates">Templates You Can Use</h2>
    <p>This is a critical area that many learners underestimate. Understanding these patterns and concepts will significantly accelerate your progress and help you avoid common plateaus.</p>

    <h2 id="tips">Pronunciation Tips</h2>
    <p>Japanese communication reflects core cultural values: respect for hierarchy, consideration for others' feelings, and careful attention to context. When you understand these values, language patterns that seemed arbitrary suddenly make perfect sense.</p>
    <p>Immerse yourself in authentic Japanese media to observe how native speakers adjust their language across different social contexts. This builds cultural intuition far more effectively than memorizing rules from a textbook.
